# LearnDD
A repository marking my current progress through learnopengl.com. I've decided to go full Vulkan mode taking advantage of buffer device addresses, descriptor indexing, and the like. I've also decided to limit the rest of my libs to STL and Win32, as I'd like to make few concessions to third party libs so I have more oppurtunities to test my design skills.

Built for Windows with GCC 12.1 and gnu make from MSYS2.

Requires an SSE4.1 compatible processor and Vulkan 1.3.

Only the code and resources I've personally made are subject to copyright under GPLv2 and are marked as such. Third party content is found within "third_party" folders and are to be respected as they are licensed.
