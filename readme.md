# LearnOpenGLDD
A repository marking my current progress through learnopengl.com. I've decided to experiment on certain aspects to test myself. One such is the omission of GLFW and GLM.

Built for Windows with GCC 11.2 and make from MSYS2.

Only the code I've personally written is subject to copyright under GPLv2 and is marked as such. Other content is to be respected as they are licensed.
