# LearnDD
A repository marking my current progress through learnopengl.com. I've decided to experiment on a lot of aspects to test myself. One such is the omission of GLFW and GLM. And now I'm doing it in Vulkan.

Built for Windows with GCC 11.2 and gnu make from MSYS2.

Requires an SSE4.1 compatible processor and Vulkan 1.3.
